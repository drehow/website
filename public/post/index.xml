      <description>Introduction Sometimes the goal of an analysis requires you to gather data from different sources. And even when you can get by with only using one souce, it could take the form of several separate Excel spreadsheets from the marketing department, or an enterprise-wide data warehouse, for example. Sooner or later, you’ll need to join multiple data sets together.
Imagine that you are analyzing your last year’s worth of exercise data from your fitbit.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
