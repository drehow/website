      <description>Student Opinion AnalysisEnd-of-semester feedback from students in my “Intro to Data Science” course at ORU. The responses are voluntary and anonymous, and I usually incentivize completion with extra credit, but I still have only gotten around a 70% completion rate since starting the course (about 18 total submissions). If you’re viewing on a phone, it looks better in landscape.
