      <description>Stock markets behave in opposite ways depending on whether you&#39;re perspective is micro- or macroscopic. It&#39;s easy to forecast that our economy will be bigger in the distant future than it is now, but difficult to estimate where it will be in a month. As a result, it&#39;s harder to trade profitable options than it is to make profitable long-term trades in index funds. This article explores the different levels of randomness you get from highly observed stock indexes depending on the length of time under scrutiny.</description>

      <description>Student Opinion Analysis End-of-semester feedback from students in my &amp;quot;Intro to Data Science&amp;quot; course at ORU. The responses are voluntary and anonymous, and I usually incentivize completion with extra credit, but I still have only gotten around a 70% completion rate since starting the course (about 18 total submissions). If you&#39;re viewing on a phone, it looks better in landscape.
