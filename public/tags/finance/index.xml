      <description>Stock markets behave in opposite ways depending on whether you’re perspective is micro- or macroscopic. It’s easy to forecast that our economy will be bigger in the distant future than it is now, but difficult to estimate where it will be in a month. As a result, it’s harder to trade profitable options than it is to make profitable long-term trades in index funds. This article explores the different levels of randomness you get from highly observed stock indexes depending on the length of time under scrutiny.</description>

      <description>My Experience of Data Science in BankingMy first career job in analytics was at a bank. My first project was to try to replicate a white paper on machine learning for mortgage prepayment predictions. After a lot of time and effort, I failed to replicate the model and ended up with what basically amounted to a linear model. Looking back, it was a ridiculous ask for my skillset at the time -- just finished a master&#39;s in data science, no finance background, and prepayment modelling is one of the biggest quantitative challenges in the fixed-income industry -- but my boss at least seemed to view the results as more helpful than not, so I moved on.</description>
