<p>Stock markets behave in opposite ways depending on whether you’re perspective is micro- or macroscopic. It’s easy to forecast that our economy will be bigger in the distant future than it is now, but difficult to estimate where it will be in a month. As a result, it’s harder to trade profitable options than it is to make profitable long-term trades in index funds. This article explores the different levels of randomness you get from highly observed stock indexes depending on the length of time under scrutiny.</p>
<p>We start by making use of the idea that a time-series (value for a single measurement at different times) line can be deconstructed into several components. For instance, let’s look at the last ten years of daily average temperature readings in Tulsa.</p>

<p>Two things are evident in this graph: the temperatures are rising on average over the decade, and they fluctuate regularly in a single year. We are talking about the trend component and the seasonality component, respectively. See below:</p>
