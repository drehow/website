<h1>My Experience of Data Science in Banking</h1>
<hr />
<p>My first career job in analytics was at a bank. My first project was to try to replicate a white paper on machine learning for mortgage prepayment predictions. After a lot of time and effort, I failed to replicate the model and ended up with what basically amounted to a linear model. Looking back, it was a ridiculous ask for my skillset at the time -- just finished a master's in data science, no finance background, and prepayment modelling is one of the biggest quantitative challenges in the fixed-income industry -- but my boss at least seemed to view the results as more helpful than not, so I moved on. I still work there, two years later and in a different position, but that first year as a &quot;professional&quot; data analyst taught me a lot about the importance of contextual knowledge and the general forms data science can take at a mid-size financial institution.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning or Data Disaster Relief?</h2>
<p>One of my last classes before graduation was about data warehousing, mainly the theories from Inman and Kimball. So when I got to the bank, the first thing that shocked me was that there were like four different databases that I had to query from. Each one had different nomenclature for the fields and tables, and some had a reputation for giving &quot;more reliable&quot; data than others for certain branches of the bank. Collectively there were maybe 500 tables and 15,000 fields. I don't think I had a reliable data dictionary for any of the databases for the first several months. It was a mess, my basic understanding of star schemas was useless, and I never had full confidence that I was using it right, which lead to less confidence in the output of my analyses.</p>
<p>I learned the ideal version of data science: in the classroom, where the &quot;data pipeline&quot; (a csv from the professor) starts off your project with clean data. Granted that we also had classes on cleaning and preparing data, the reality of my workplace still caught me off guard. I spent about 20% of my time actually analyzing data and writing reports, and the remainder of it trying to write a cleaning script that would attend to all of the possible errors or inconsistensies in the source data. Projects of mine that received the most positive feedback were often as simple as parsing a text file into a table and emailing it to the end user.</p>
<p>At first, I was put off by the experience. It was a far cry from what I imagined myself doing when I decided to study data science. I considered applying to larger companies that I thought would have a better data infrastructure in IT, and more specialized roles for its analysts. But then I started to view it as a Maslow's heriarchy of needs situation, brilliantly illustrated in this analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To my dog, treats are more important than laying on the couch. Even though the couch seems to offer her a huge benefit, she cares more about eating. The bank needed clean, tabular data more than an accurate loan behavior forecast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, and sort of to the point of this section, I think similar or worse data infrastructures than that of the bank in 2019 are probably still the majority class for companies today. And that's because setting up reliable infrastructure and governing huge volumes of data isn't easy. It's complicated, meticulous, and continuously improving.</p>
<p>Building an automated system for running my R jobs purely dedicated to delivering clean, reliable data started to seem like the most useful thing I could apply my skillset to. I got approval to spend some time on it and it worked out after a couple iterations. Now it's been running almost 50 daily and 10 monthly jobs for over a year. I had to build a user inteface and documentation for other analysts using R to schedule jobs on the server. People across the organization use flat files delivered from that cleaning server as the reference for their reports and analyses. My first career win involved no analyis of data, not to speak of modelling.</p>
