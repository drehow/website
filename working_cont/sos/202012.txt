Very rewarding. Drew is a very solid addition, hope he is able to stick around.



Please name and describe what was most rewarding about this course for you.
Learning R and data science analysis was very interesting.

Course was presented as a deep dive into many subjects, all of which would require several semesters to really do justice. Given the scope, Prof Howell did very well. At times, was more of an R course, but I can't see any other way around this, functionally.

Learning some basic on how to code.



If you could change anything about the course, what would it be?
I wish there was more student interaction during lectures.

Nothing.



Please provide any other comments about the course, the degree program, or the department in general that you feel would be of interest or important to the instructor or to the leadership of the department.
Professor Howell was very understanding of the students and I was able to develop a relationship with him. I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to put forth the effort and keep trying when things get difficult. Professor Howell will work with you and make sure you don't fall behind.

Prof Howell is very well prepared to teach in this area and I hope to see this continue. Very professional.
